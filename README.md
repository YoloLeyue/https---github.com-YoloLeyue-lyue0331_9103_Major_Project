# 3D Audio Visualizer

This interactive 3D audio visualizer transforms audio frequencies into a dynamic display of cubes that pulsate and vary in height with the beat of the music. Inspired by Edvard Munch's "The Scream", this visualization offers a modern representation of audio analysis in the form of a creative and responsive web experience.

## Interaction Instructions

- **Play/Pause**: Use the `-PLAY-` button at the top center of the screen to toggle audio playback. When audio is playing, the button will display `PAUSE`, and when paused, it will show `_PLAY_`.
- **Resizing**: The visualizer is fully responsive and will adapt to the size of the browser window. Resizing the window will reposition elements for optimal viewing.
- **Viewing Angles**: Use your mouse to click and drag around the canvas to view the visualizer from different angles.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL and the Web Audio API (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the visualizer.
3. Press the `-PLAY-` button to start the visualization.
